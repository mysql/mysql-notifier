MySQL Notifier 1.1.5 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL Notifier 1.1.5

* Edition of MySQL Workbench connections right from the Monitor MySQL Server Instance window of the MySQL Notifier (accessed through Actions
  > Manage Monitored Items... > Add... > MySQL Instance). Any of the listed MySQL Workbench connections can be right-clicked and a new "Edit
  Connection" context menu is available for users to edit the Workbench connection properties.  This feature shines brighter when MySQL
  Workbench is not installed since users only relied on MySQL Workbench to edit a connection, without Workbench users had to delete a 
  connection and create it again with updated values.
* When there were MySQL instances being monitored at Notifier created from a Workbench connection,  if they were deleted using MySQL Workbench
  the connections would not be removed from the Notifier until a manual restart. These external changes to the connections file are now being
  monitored automatically and MySQL instances refreshed accordingly.



MySQL Notifier 1.1.4 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL Notifier 1.1.4

* Monitoring of services in remote Windows computers through WMI (see 'WMI Configuration' below this section for details).
  - Remote services can be started, stopped and restarted (just as local services on MySQL Notifier 1.0).
	- Balloon notifications are displayed for each monitored remote service status change (just as local services on MySQL Notifier 1.0)
  - Monitored services (local and remote) are grouped and saved by machine.
  - Windows services are automatically added in any monitored machine (localhost or remote) as long as the service names contain the text
    specified in the "Automatically add new services whose name contains:" option. By default this option is set to "mysql".
  - Remote Machines status are checked regularly (via a configurable timer) to generate notifications about machines going online/offline.
* Monitoring of MySQL Instances (multi-platform) via a configurable timer.
  - Instances can be monitored by selecting existing MySQL Workbench connections and balloon notifications are displayed for each
	  monitored instance status change.
  - MySQL Workbench connections are maintained directly in MySQL Workbench files if installed or in MySQL Notifer files otherwise, and
	  are migrated to MySQL Workbench when it is installed.
	- Monitored instances display the SQL Editor and Configure Instance menus (as similar local services do) and the connection used to
	  monitor the instance is displayed in bold.
	- MySQL Notifier is launched right after installed and on every restart. This behavior can be changed through the options Window.

Known Limitations
--------------------
* MySQL Workbench-related menus (SQL Editor and Configure Instance) are not available for monitored remote services.
  Workaround: Open MySQL Workbench and select the connection of the monitored remote service.
* MySQL Workbench connections used to monitor MySQL instances cannot be edited, just added or deleted.
  Workaround: Open MySQL Workbench and edit the desired connection.



MySQL Notifier 1.0.3 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL Notifier 1.0.3

MySQL Notifier provides the following features:
* Runs in the notification area
* Monitors any service
* Allows easy access to start/stop/restart services
* Notifies you of running state changes on the services
* Provides easy access to edit and configure options for MySQL services
* Integrates with MySQL Workbench
* Integrate seamless with MySQL Installer to inform you of updates to your products

Known Issues
--------------------
* All Windows - Selecting SQL Editor from a MySQL service that doesn't have a Workbench connection opens Workbench in the home screen.
  Workaround: Create a local connection in Workbench with the MySQL service used in the Notifier so the SQL Editor could use this connection.
* Windows XP - The Scheduled Task created by the Notifier to Check for Updates does not have valid credentials and cannot be run.
  Workaround: Update the "MySQLNotifierTask" in Windows XP with some valid credentials.
